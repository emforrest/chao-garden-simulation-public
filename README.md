## A fun project recreating the Chao Garden from the Sonic Adventure games in a text-based Java simulation
Over the summer I have been working on this little fan project. The Sonic Adventure games on the Dreamcast feature a section called the Chao Garden, where you hatch and raise adorable little creatures called Chao which can have all sorts of colours and stats. I personally never actually owned these games, but I have a lot of nostalgia watching my cousin play them when we would visit, and she would create me my own Chao sometimes. I thought it would be fun to create a little text-based simulation of the Chao Garden to keep up my programming skills during the summer.

The project relies heavily on a database which I am hosting on a remote server and editing using SQL commands. I had especially wanted to practise making use of the remote server, so this was a big plus. Also it has been really useful to revisit SQL since my A-levels and practise using MySQL Workbench effectively.

*Note - I am currently working on making the database suitable for public release. At the moment, running the code will not work due to the way the database is handled. For now feel free to look through the code, and hopefully this will be fixed in a later update.*

This is still a work in progress; I am adding features from the original game and my own new features one at a time, and this may be evidenced by some unfinished elements in the current version.
